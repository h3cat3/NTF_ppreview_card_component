## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learn how to apliy a mask over a picture when hover above the picture.
I have made the 2 images have a relative and move the second picture above the fisrt one with 0 opacity and -1 z-index.
when the picture is hovered, the opacity changes to 40% and z-index to 2.
The 2 images are in a div continer with a set height, to not influence the other elements on the page.
